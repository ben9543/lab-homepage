## Github Deployment Guide

- The website is published by Github Pages
- Any changes on the code will be reflected in 5 - 10 mins on the actual website
- Sometimes if the code is not significant, the change won't be recognized by Github (e.g. Adding one or two lines on JavaScript files). 

    - I'm guessing it's because Github tries to avoid to waste its resources to build the website. Or their deployment structure has brutal caching system so that it can ignore unrecognizable changes.

    - Based on my experience, the best way to apply the changes are:
        1. Insert any link on any HTML.
        2. Modify the README.md
        3. Add some files.
